        This simple pudding is light and seasonal- flavour your fruit with orange blossom water and sweet honey then serve with crunchy biscuits
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750g firm plum (mixed varieties if you can get them)</li>
        <li>140g clear honey</li>
        <li>4 tbsp orange blossom water</li>
        <li>300ml orange juice</li>
        <li>biscuits and Greek yogurt (or frozen yogurt), to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Put the plums in a pan with just enough water to cover them, then pour over the honey, orange blossom water and juice. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 15 mins until the plums 
            are tender through to the stone, but not mushy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Using a slotted spoon, lift out the plums to a serving dish. Bring the liquid back to the boil and simmer to a thin syrup. Pour over the plums and leave to cool. 
            (You can peel the plums to serve, if you like a posher finish.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with crunchy biscuits like our Honey-bread biscuits, and Greek or frozen yogurt.</p></li>
    </ol>
